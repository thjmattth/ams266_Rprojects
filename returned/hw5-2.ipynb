    "This graph excells in its visual cues in that it uses the expected colors(bronze, silver, and gold) to represent the different medals, which eliminates the need for a legend to explain the colors. It's main issue is with the scale of the visualizations. While USA has over double the amount of medals than the Soviet Union, the scale of the bar makes it seems like it only has slightly more. In fact, each of the sections of USA should be about double the size they are now. The scale between Great Britain and Russia is about correct however. To change this visualition, I would correct the scale for the USA bar to represent the actual number of the medals won, effectively doubling the size of the chart. "

    "The top half of this visualization is quite effective. The question on the top gives context, and the large 89% shows the main piece of information that is trying to be conveyed, in that protecting libraries is crucial. However the pie chart seems largely unneccessary and if anything confusing the message that's attempting to be conveyed. Since it doesn't have any context it's not clear what it's being used for. In an attempt to improve this visualization, I would probably completely remove the pie chart. While this might not be the most accurate way to present the data, I believe that in this case since the message that is trying to be conveyed is that people like libraries, the most important aspect is to stress the overwhelming majority. If I were to leave in the pie chart, I would probably just make it a pie chart that has 89% in green and then the other 11% just in gray. "

To improve this visualition to make it more accurate, I would correct the scale fo the chart, and put them all in the same color, probably red to math the palette of the piece. However, I do believe this is an effective advertisement and way to manipulate the data to make it work in your favor, which I'm sure was their intention.

    "This visualation is very confusing, to the point where I'm not exactly sure what the different sections of the graph are referring to. A major issue with this graph is that it's using area of semicircles to represent values, which is hard to compare the different numbers. Another issue is that each of the different semicircles have a gradient of color instead of a single color, so it's even harder to see where the seperations are. It seems as though sometimes the semicircles use all the area from the center to the end, but some only use where the previous semicircle lets out. To make this more clear, there would be several options. I think this could be effective slightly if more context was used, especially what some of the numbers on the inside mean. You could set all the colors to be pure colors instead of gradients and make the coordinate systems the same for each quandrant. However, a more accurate representation could be stacked bar graphs that convey the same information, and would also compare the sizes of the different subsidies. The issue with this would be that some would be really small and some would be very large, but the data would actually be presented more accurately."
